 * Apply the c2c session migrations (AI governance, PV operational tables,
 * commitments, drafting-council provisioning) to the configured database,
 * idempotently.
 *
 * These live in the root `migrations/` folder as raw .sql (the established
 * convention for phase migrations here), which drizzle's runtime migrate() does
 * NOT apply (only the journaled baseline is). This script gives a single,
 * standard, idempotent command to apply them on the out-of-band path — for the
 * preview DB and deploys. Each file is CREATE/ALTER ... IF NOT EXISTS, so it is
 * safe to run repeatedly.
 *
 * Usage: APPLY_C2C_MIGRATIONS=true npm run db:apply-c2c

// Dependency-safe order: governance ALTERs ana_capability_registry (pre-existing),
// PV + commitments create their own tables, council provisioning seeds the four
// drafting-council agents into the lumen schema.
//
// Entries are repo-relative so a root-lineage file can declare a prerequisite that
// lives in the canonical db/migrations lineage. 044b is that prerequisite: it owns
// the ONLY definition of lumen.data_atoms, and the council file that follows it
// reads from that table. Applying it here means this out-of-band path provisions
// the same shape the manifest lineage does, instead of racing it under
// CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS. See ledger C-12.
// ── Data-room / evidence lineage (added 2026-07-26) ────────────────────────
// ORDER MATTERS. The spine creates cre_evidence_sources; the program-scope
// migration ALTERs it. The spine entry is repo-relative into db/migrations for
// the same reason 044b is: a root-lineage file declares a prerequisite that
// lives in the canonical lineage.
//
// Why the spine is listed here at all: it has been merged since 20260724 and IS
// present in db/migrations/migrations_manifest.json, but NOTHING consumes that
// manifest — it is ordering metadata, and readiness-audit.mjs only reports. The
// other applier, preview_db_test, applies only migrations a PR *adds*, to an
// ephemeral Neon branch deleted when the PR closes. So the spine was applied
// once to a throwaway branch and never to a real database, and every cre_*
// write (CSR adapter, CRL ingestion, chat-upload source identity) has been
// hitting a table that does not exist. This list is the only durable path, so
// it is where the gap gets closed.
//
// The wider problem stands: merged and applied have diverged silently across
// 358 migrations because the manifest is not authoritative for anything. Making
// something consume it is a separate change to how schema ships.

  // Program scope for authoring documents: a guarded ALTER that adds
  // client_program_id to authoring_documents. This is deliberately the ONLY
  // authoring entry here. The loop tables and their compliance companions
  // (20260725_authoring_audit_trail, _signatures_and_workflow,
  // _signature_freeze_binding) are a subsystem that must be provisioned
  // TOGETHER — provisioning the loop tables alone would stand up freeze/e-sign
  // without their audit/signature tables (unaudited freeze, failing e-sign).
  // That subsystem is owned by the db/migrations lineage, not this
  // supplementary applier, so this ALTER just adds one column WHERE the
  // subsystem is provisioned: it self-guards on to_regclass and no-ops with a
  // NOTICE where authoring_documents is not (yet) present, rather than failing
  // the run or provisioning half a subsystem.

  // CEDED TO THE RULE ABOVE. This branch also listed
  // db/migrations/20260725_authoring_document_loop_tables.sql here, arguing that
  // the authoring router writes to tables no durable path creates. That gap is
  // real, but the fix was wrong: the loop tables create frozen_documents and
  // user_pins, while authoring_audit_trail and authoring_signatures live in
  // separate files. Applying the loop tables ALONE makes freeze succeed with no
  // audit row (router L387) and e-sign fail outright (L3083) — a working freeze
  // with no audit trail is worse on a Part 11 surface than tables that are
  // plainly absent. The entry was removed rather than reworded.
  //
  // What remains is one guarded index, matching the pattern above exactly: it
  // self-guards on to_regclass and no-ops with a NOTICE where authoring_citations
  // is absent, so it adds an index WHERE the subsystem is provisioned and does
  // nothing where it is not.
